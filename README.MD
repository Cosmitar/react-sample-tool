#React sample mailing tool
I made this by a customer requirement, using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) and [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
The goal is the automatization of a customer service after-sale email.

They can input the destination emails, about 8 addresses.
The DropBox URL where assets for customers are stored and an optional text to add in the email.

***the tool has a login page (hacked for this sample)***
***Email template is not included.***
